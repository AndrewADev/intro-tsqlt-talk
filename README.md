# tsqlt-talk
An introduction to the tSQLt framework, which can be used to write unit tests for SQL Server in T-SQL

# Prerequisites
Some of the examples here use the AdventureWorks2014 database, available [here](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550). Make sure to download the 'classic' (non-DW, non-OLTP) version.

A version of tSQLt is currently included, but might not be up-to-date. The most up-to-date version is available from the website for [tSQLt](http://tsqlt.org/).

# Caveats
It comes up pretty early in the presentation, but one should realize that tSQLt requires use of CLR assemblies to achieve some of its awesomeness. (In case CLR is a no-go)

# Demo

Example scripts are numbered in the order they are used, and appear in the presentation. Sometimes there is more than one slide to a script.
